# Multi-round evaluation examples for training
# Each example has:
#   - system_prompt: optional system prompt for the conversation
#   - messages: list of user/assistant turns
#   - drop_rounds: dict mapping round_id -> list of rounds to drop before generating that round
#                  e.g., {2: [1]} means drop round 1 before generating round 2's response
